        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p1><b>Our Beautiful Journey</b><br><br>

            It all started in March 2022‚Äîa day that, at the time, felt simple, but looking back, it was the beginning of something truly special. I still remember how stunning you looked in your pink top and blue denim, and how effortlessly we connected. We met at Care, ordered a sandwich, a brownie, and some fries, but it wasn‚Äôt really about the food. It was about the way we talked, the way we laughed, and how natural everything felt between us.
            
            Later, we went to Meherun Lake, and that moment still stays with me. There was something so peaceful about just being there with you. It wasn‚Äôt about grand gestures; it was about the comfort and ease of being in each other‚Äôs presence. Even then, I think a part of me knew that you were going to be someone incredibly special in my life.
            
            As time passed, my feelings for you grew stronger. Every conversation, every little moment we shared made me realize how much I admired you‚Äînot just for your kindness and warmth but for the way you understood me without me even having to say a word. You became my safe space, my happiness, and the person I looked forward to talking to every day.
            
            Then came April 4, 2024‚Äîthe day that changed everything. The early morning when you accepted me as your life partner will always be etched in my heart. That moment was beyond words, beyond anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my entire world had just fallen into place. You chose me, and that made me feel like the luckiest person alive.
            
            Since then, every single day with you has been a blessing. You, with your beautiful Gujarati charm, have filled my life with love and joy in a way no one else ever could. Whether it‚Äôs in the big moments or the quiet ones, everything with you just feels right.
            
            As we celebrate our first anniversary, I can‚Äôt help but look back at our journey with a heart full of gratitude. We‚Äôve come so far, and I know this is just the beginning of a lifetime of love, laughter, and endless memories together.</p1>
